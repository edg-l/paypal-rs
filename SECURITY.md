## Reporting a Vulnerability

<!--Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.-->

Send an email with the details to the email <git at edgarluque.com>. Hopefully I can answer within 10 days.
